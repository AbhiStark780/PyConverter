That is a fantastic choice. ⚖️ The Unit Converter is a classic "Logic Trap." It looks easy on the surface, but if you don't structure your data correctly, you end up with 100 messy `if/elif` statements.

Since you want **pure Python** practice with **little guidance**, I am not going to write a single line of code.

Instead, I will give you the **Architecture Blueprint**. Think of this as the requirements document a manager would hand you.

### 📜 The Blueprint: Unit Converter V1.0

#### 1. The Core Data Structure (The "Brain") 🧠
As a Data Analyst, you know that *how* you store data determines how easy it is to access.
* **Bad Approach:** Writing a specific function for every conversion (e.g., `def km_to_miles():`, `def miles_to_km():`).
* **Pro Approach:** Store the "conversion factors" in a **Dictionary**.
    * *Hint:* Maybe a nested dictionary? Or just simple key-value pairs?
    * *Math Hint:* To keep it simple, you might want to pick a "Base Unit" for each category (e.g., convert everything to **Meters** first, then convert to the target unit). Or, just stick to specific pairs like `km_to_miles`.

#### 2. The User Flow 6️⃣
1.  **Welcome Message:** Display available categories (Length, Weight, Temperature).
2.  **Category Selection:** User picks one.
3.  **Input Unit:** User types "km". (Handle "KM", "Km", "km" using `.lower()`).
4.  **Target Unit:** User types "miles".
5.  **Validation:** Check if you actually know how to convert "km" to "miles". If not, print an error.
6.  **Value Input:** User enters `10`. (What if they enter "ten"? Handle that error!).
7.  **Calculation & Output:** Print the result formatted nicely (e.g., `10 km = 6.21 miles`).
8.  **Loop:** Ask "Convert something else? (y/n)".

#### 3. The "Analyst" Twist (Bonus) 📈
If you finish the logic early and want a challenge:
* **Log the Data:** Every time a conversion happens, append it to a list or a simple text file (`history.txt`).
    * *Format:* `10 km -> 6.21 miles`
* Add a menu option to "View History" that prints previous calculations.

### 🛠️ Your Toolkit
* **Dictionaries `{}`**: For storing rates.
* **`while True` Loop**:

 To keep the program running.
* **`try/except`**: To catch it if the user types text instead of numbers for the amount.
* **F-strings**: For the final output.

### 🏁 Starting Line
1.  Create a folder: `Unit_Converter`
2.  `git init` (Don't forget!)
3.  Create `converter.py`
4.  Create `README.md` (Plan your logic there first!)

You are on your own now. Good luck, Engineer. 🫡

ay 1: The Blueprint (Setup)

    Goal: Set up the project environment and define the plan.

    Tasks:

        Create folder Unit_Converter.

        Run git init.

        Create README.md and fill in the template I gave you earlier.

        Create converter.py (leave it empty for now).

        Git: git add . -> git commit -m "Initial setup"

    Time: ~30-45 mins.

    Teacher’s Note: Do not write code today. Just get the plan clear in your head.

Day 2: The Brain (Data Structure)

    Goal: Create the dictionary that holds your conversion rates.

    Tasks:

        Open converter.py.

        Create a nested dictionary called conversions.

        Add just one category first (e.g., "Length").

        Add keys like "km_to_miles", "miles_to_km".

        Git: Commit your changes.

    Time: ~45 mins.

    Teacher’s Note: Don't worry about inputs yet. Just look up the math and store the numbers.

Day 3: The Logic (Hardcoded Test)

    Goal: Make the math work without user input.

    Tasks:

        Write a simple script below your dictionary.

        Create dummy variables: amount = 10, from_unit = "km", to_unit = "miles".

        Write the logic to look up the rate and multiply.

        print the result. Verify the math is right.

        Git: Commit.

    Time: ~45 mins.

    Teacher’s Note: If 10 * rate works, the hard part is done.

Day 4: The Interaction (User Input)

    Goal: Replace dummy variables with real user input.

    Tasks:

        Add input() statements for "Category", "From", "To", and "Amount".

        Add a simple print statement to show the result.

        Test it manually.

        Git: Commit.

    Time: ~60 mins.

    Teacher’s Note: This is the day it starts feeling like an app!

Day 5: The Safety Net (Error Handling)

    Goal: Stop the app from crashing.

    Tasks:

        Wrap the math part in a try...except block (in case user types "ten" instead of "10").

        Add if/else checks to make sure the unit they typed actually exists in your dictionary.

        Git: Commit.

    Time: ~45 mins.

Day 6: The Infinite Loop (UX Flow)

    Goal: Let the user convert multiple things without restarting.

    Tasks:

        Wrap the whole logic in a while True: loop.

        Add the "Do you want to continue? (y/n)" logic at the bottom.

        Git: Commit.

    Time: ~45 mins.

Day 7: The Polish & Ship (Final Review)

    Goal: Make it pretty and upload.

    Tasks:

        Check your variable names (are they readable?).

        Format the output nicely (e.g., 10.00 km = 6.21 miles using f-strings).

        Git: Final push to GitHub.

    Time: ~30 mins.
